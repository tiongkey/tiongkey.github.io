## Using the internet as leverage

### Learning tactics
In school we learned from the teachers who taught material taken from a textbook, authored by whoever. Now we have direct access to the best thinkers and doers *in the world* just by reading through tweets, blogs, Youtube channels and whatever else they make available online.

The keyword is **direct access to the best**. In my notes, you'll learn how to find the best people and resources online about whatever it is you're trying to learn. (Spoiler: it's as simple as following people on Twitter)

### Internet products
One difference between a physical product like a car and a digital product (apps) like GCash or Grab is the marginal cost of production. One unit of a car has one buyer, while one app reaches multiple users.

My notes about what I'll generlize as "internet products" come from my experience in product management. I am not a programmer or coder. My involvement in creation of apps comes more in the form of doing user research and translating the insights into what the user should experience.
